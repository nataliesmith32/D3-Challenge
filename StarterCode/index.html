          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Poverty and Obesity Across the US</h2>
          <p>The data represented above was collected in 2014 and allows us an insight on the population of the US.
            Taking the measurements of Poverty and Obesity across all 50 states, we can determine which locations are most 
            impacted with high obesity rates as well as high poverty rates.</p>
          <p>Upon general review of the data, it can be seen that most often states that experience high poverty levels also share
            a positive correlation with high obesity levels. It can be assumed that with less economical resources this too impacts the variety of food sources.
          
          <p>Looking into greater layers of the data, we can also see that a signifigant representation of these numbers come from what can be considered
            "Southern" states (MS, AR, LA, AL, KY, etc.). Should we look into additional variables, such as income we could raise other questions regarding the geographical location
          and its impact on these figures.</p>  

          <p>Lastly, we can see in contrast most states moderate right in the center of the data spectrum. There are a few interesting outliers such as DC which has both extremely high poverty 
            but very low obesity rates. Colorado and Hawaii seem to have moderately low obesity and poverty rates. Again, interest in location can definitely play into the two sets we examine here for Poverty and Obesity rates.
